I‚Äôm Randy. Welcome to the podcast. With us today we have.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Bryce</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I‚Äôm Bryce Glass.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I‚Äôm Marc Smith.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we can go straight to our first news items and it‚Äôs going to be a rumor this week. I‚Äôve been out in about in the industry talking to lots of people and the buzz that‚Äôs going on now is that Facebook is talking about closing the open graph and limiting‚Äîrate limiting‚Äîthe number of people who can use applications connecting to Facebook connect. I wanted to get our opinions on that presuming that‚Äôs true. Marc, you use systems like this for NodeXL don‚Äôt you?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I‚Äôm using a lot of APIs from social media services but I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm familiar with this particular decision. It does sound like a step in a larger pattern in which these APIs are restricted after years of being relatively open and accessible. Well within the rights of these organizations to do so but it does seem like a change in the nature of the internet that once these sites get to have rich enough and valuable enough content, then they‚Äôre no longer available.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryce?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Bryce</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. I mean I hear that rumor and I think of kind of the implications that kind of all along the stack for users, developers, publishers and for Facebook. For users what does that mean? Do applications just stop working? You and I have published quite a bit about application trust, all these mobile apps with people have asked very credible questions like ‚Äúshould I install this thing?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo I want a relationship with this app?‚Äù Facebook has been a very intimate part of that for an entire ecosystem of social apps. What does that look like in coming months as that starts to get repealed. How do the publishers differentiate?</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a little bit I think we‚Äôre going to talk about the value of having or not having your own social network and with clients and consulting work I‚Äôve always kind of hewn toward the advice of ‚Äúwhy have it if Facebook has already got it?‚Äù Well, I think we‚Äôve got a pretty credible answer to why you might want to invest in your own at this point.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, that‚Äôs the problem, right? You‚Äôve got the number one social network who established the&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;identity model. As a consultant I‚Äôd been recommending it for years. Now all of the sudden those people can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ those users can‚Äôt have their data updated. There are calendar applications and a contacts application that now will not be up-to-date. Facebook is thinking‚Äîand I‚Äôve seen this before with Facebook credits‚Äîthat someone else is capturing more value from their data then they are and therefore somehow it‚Äôs a bad thing. It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre capturing what value you are capturing from that data.‚Äù I don‚Äôt see the advantage to encourage the creation of thousands of other social networks separate from Facebook, no.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so it will be interesting to see how this unveils itself and let‚Äôs move on to our next topic.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our main topic today‚Äîkind of social networking 101‚Äîwhat is a social network? Why would I care? How do I get one? I‚Äôm going to start with the real quick story about what is not a social network. There are a lot of people think they know what it is. I‚Äôve received calls as a consultant in social media with people who wanted to set up social networks. One came from a man who said, ‚ÄúI want to set up a social network that doesn‚Äôt exist yet and that is for waitresses, waiters and bartenders.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúA waitress in Poughkeepsie and a bartender in Florida?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWell, they have things in common but they don‚Äôt have any reason to interact with each other.‚Äù</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That to me what‚Äôs at the core of a social network is that social connection that there is something they need to do together. So, social networks include cancer survivor groups who use mailing lists. They include your friend‚Äôs network is what most people think of on something like a Facebook or your coworker‚Äôs network on LinkedIn. There are lots of specialized cases. There are social networks that are set up temporarily: line parties with films. It‚Äôs a very broad category but because it‚Äôs broad, it doesn‚Äôt mean that everything you can think of is a social network.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Bryce</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. I think certainly there are kind of different occasions for sociality to form but it‚Äôs in the eye of the practitioner or the prognosticator to figure out exactly how likely that is to happen. Danah Boyd has published quite a bit about the fact that social networks online tend to mirror social connections that happen offline and there‚Äôs also kind of a large body of evidence out there about the notion of social objects. So, there are many sites. YouTube is probably the one that springs to mind most closely where it‚Äôs the thing that bring people together in order to comment and form connections much more so than any prior shared affinity. But absolutely I think if you‚Äôre struggling to find out what that thing would be in the first place, then your first inclination probably shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúlet‚Äôs put a formal structure around it and see what emerges.‚Äù</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I‚Äôm a sociologist and we see social networks everywhere but social network has come to mean the group of people who share some mutual value. I think there is a lesser definition of social network which is any group of people who connect but to Randy‚Äôs point these were group of people who were unlikely to connect.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So social networks are really any set of connections among a group of people. Some social networks become valuable to their contributors and their participants because there‚Äôs mutual value to be generated. Some barely exist at all and are really trivial or sort of just casual. You go to the same Starbucks I go to but we don‚Äôt go there at the same time. There‚Äôs a connection but it‚Äôs not a meaningful connection. I call you regularly. That‚Äôs a more meaningful connection but I only call you between 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday. That‚Äôs a certain kind of connection.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there‚Äôs all sorts of social connections. It‚Äôs just that when social connections become dense, when they become reciprocal, when they take on certain structures and deliver value to their participants, then we bestow the added value of ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù but there are lots of kinds of social networks and they‚Äôre just not all meaningful.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right and that‚Äôs where I was going with the ‚Äúwhy do I care ‚Äúquestion. So, if you‚Äôre doing product design‚Äîspecifically web or mobile‚Äîwhat you‚Äôre looking for is networks that have a reason to communicate and to share or to create for each other. Random or arbitrary tag-matching just won‚Äôt cut it. So, when we ask about ‚Äúhow do I get one?‚Äù, it‚Äôs kind of ironic that our news today &nbsp;is that my first recommendation when I first started putting together this podcast was to say, ‚ÄúWell, just use Facebook‚Äôs or use LinkedIn‚Äôs if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to work for your application.‚Äù Now, I‚Äôm a little more frightened that may not work for you.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But keep in mind, there‚Äôs one more thing that enters into this and that is the&nbsp;<em>scale</em>. When most people are talking about social networking from a marketing point of view or a user-generated content point of view, they‚Äôre looking at the large networks. But‚Äîit‚Äôs surprising‚Äîthe vast majority of social networking is taking place in very small social networks and we call those like mailing lists. Often your application doesn‚Äôt need a huge friend graph with reciprocal connections that are difficult and expensive to set up or to import. Sometimes you just need a topical mailing list. Sometimes you get one by just signing up all your friends or using SMS groups.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Bryce</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randy I‚Äôd like to echo that and kind of amplify it too. I think it‚Äôs really critical to be hypercritical about your needs and I‚Äôm thinking in the product development process of how small decisions early on can lead to kind of exponential increase in work down the road. So, if you start down the path of, ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs recreate the full social functions of a Facebook or a LinkedIn for our particular needs.‚Äù Well, now you‚Äôre thinking about things like relationship management and reciprocity and invite processes and email communications‚Ä¶ I mean, subsystems upon subsystems upon subsystems some of which represent months of work. What about a notification system, so users know when something has changed in there?</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We look at Facebook and they‚Äôve done a pretty good job of it. We think ‚ÄúHow hard could it be to emulate what they‚Äôve got?‚Äù Turns out‚Äî it‚Äôs pretty darn hard.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, but it‚Äôs pretty darn hard at that scale and I guess I‚Äôm wondering, based on the news in Randy‚Äôs point, do you put your business on these platforms when they can and do arbitrarily change their terms of engagement and limit what data they will share? I think the theme of this discussion is networks: they really do have value and where do you get one? Well, you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;one‚Äîyou just may not really own it. You may have inscribed it in Facebook, in LinkedIn but you, surprisingly, may have less access to it than you thought.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you may in fact just want to discover where it is. I think that should roll into our tip for the day about NodeXL.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it‚Äôs time for our actionable tip. This is meant to be something you can take away and use today. Today,&nbsp;<a href="http://nodexl.codeplex.com/">NodeXL</a>&nbsp;with Marc Smith.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to use NodeXL without knowing all that much about NodeXL. I‚Äôll tell you a little bit about it. It is a tool for getting a social media network automatically and analyzing it and giving you a social media network visualization and report. Your first step is to do an import and my tip today is to tell you that you can download&nbsp;<em>recipes</em>&nbsp;for running NodeXL reports from our website&nbsp;<a href="http://nodexlgraphgallery.org/">nodexlgraphgallery.org</a>. &nbsp;You can think of it as ‚ÄúFlicker for network graphs.‚Äù</p><p class="MsoNormal">You get a little image and a report underneath it. At the very bottom of those pages, there is a link to the Options file. We like to think of it as the recipe. You download that file; go into NodeXL; go into the options import menu; pull that in and when you run the automation button, you will now get a result that resembles the result you see on the website. So you can get expert results just by downloading the file, importing it into the options import menu and you‚Äôll get results that look like those results.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds great and we‚Äôll include links in the podcast notes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Marc!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Marc</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Randy</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Bryce. That‚Äôs a wrap.</p></div>
